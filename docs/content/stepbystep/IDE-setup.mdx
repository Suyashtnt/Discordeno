# Installing

There are many editors for js/ts, but I recommend Visual Studio Code as its free and fast with a lot of extensions(Including a Deno one)

First, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download the installer, the installation is really easy. Check out the gif below

Once thats done open up VSC(This is how we will refer to it from now on). It might take a while as its loading the app for the first time and has not cached things yet

# Making it look better

Lets install a theme and an icon pack to make VSC look a little better.

First, go to the extensions pane

Then search for material and install the theme and icons. I like the Material Ocean Theme

# Installing the Deno extension

VSC doesn't have Deno support by default, so we will add the official extension

Go to extensions then search for deno, then click install

(You might also want the std snippets if your thinking of using deno for other things)

You are now ready to create your first bot!
