# Installing

First, go to the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the version for your OS. I'm using windows so I'll use <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Once downloaded click next and next again (unless you need to change the install location)

Make sure that on the select component screen all these are selected:

- Git LFS
- Associate .git files

Now click next, If you have a start menu folder screen just click next.

Now it will ask you for your default editor. For now set this to custom and make it `notepad`

Next, it will ask you for your `PATH environment`, make sure it is the second option(`Git from the command line and also third-party software`)

It will now ask you for your HTTPS backend, set this to `openSSL`

It will ask you for your line endings, this is how file editors see your code. CRLF(\r\n) is windows one while LF(\n) in linuxes one. I personally set this to `Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style`

Now for git bash, set this to whichever you think you like. I choose MinTTY because it looks better than Command prompt

Set `git pull`s behavior to `Default`. This is the best option as it doesn't override other peoples changes but tries to merge them.

For the credential manager, set this to `Git credential manager` or `Git credential manager core`

For extra options keep this as default

Don't enable any bleeding-edge features as it might break things. Now click install.

Git is now installed! Open a terminal and run `git --version`. If you get something similar to `git version 2.28.0.windows.1` then you are good to go!

## Basic git commands

these are the basic git commands you need to know in order to use it from the command line:

### git clone

This command downloads a repository and sets it up so you can commit, push and pull code.

usage: `git clone https://github.com/Suyashtnt/Discordeno.git`
### git pull

This pulls any commits added to the repository so you can get the latest code. You need to commit or stash any changes you have made before doing this.

usage: `git pull`

### git commit

This makes a new `commit`. A commit shows what you changed, which allows people to know who wrote that code and can revert to that commit any time.

usage: `git commit -m "changed some code"`

### git push

This pushes your code to the repository on the internet so other people can see what you added.

usage: `git push` or `git push origin master`(`origin` is the repository and `master` is the branch)
### git checkout

This allows you to switch branches. A branch is a seperate timeline of commits. Once you are done making your changes you can merge the branch to the main branch
